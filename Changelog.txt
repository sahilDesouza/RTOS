		-Implemented scheduler and tested on LED switching example
		-Implemented create task function and tested with the above example
		-Made the Reset function

	Sanjay
		-Implemented delete task function
		-Some changes to TCB handling and initialising
		-added a simple test of the delete function. Task 1 deletes itself after a delay and cannot be reenabled until reset.

		-Implemented wait for mutex  and signal mutex (not tested)
		-restructured service routines.
		-fixed some logical mistakes with how create and delete function works (minor)

		-Partial Implemention of first test program (stop watch)
		-This test program is dependant on wait timer function and will not work without that

	Sahil
		-Implemeted and tested wait function
		-tested first use case but still unsure as to when to switch between the two tasks

		-Wait function working (service routine)
		-The first example is working, but there is a delay in the timer.... 5 seconds less after 30 seconds. we will need to 				optimise or find workaround
		-The second example works good 
		-The third Example was implemented (only the sysdel part) we can make a more clever demo of the del function
		- Now that all the basic examples and service routines are working we can start working on write up 
		- Please try the examples for yourself and understand how they work.

		-Mutex function bugs fixed.
		-other functions are mostly fixed for now
		-interrupt clashing with trap call resolved 
		-wait function can be made better by using the time variable

		-Much better wait time function implemented. It uses the time variable, which updates on every timer int
		-Now the timer can be accurate even with multiple tasks running simultaneously (important to note)

		-Updated few Comments
		-Added a use case example	
	Sanjay	
		-mutex working for 3 tasks
